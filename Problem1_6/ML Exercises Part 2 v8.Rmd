# Visual story telling part 1: green buildings
The real estate developer essentially wants to know if investing in a green building would be worth it, in terms of economic benefits. And while on the first glance it made sense that the Excel guru computed the expected revenue using the median rent values for green buildings, it could not be that straightforward, can it? Maybe - it is possible that the higher rent values in green building is due to them being green, but it is also possible that it is there due to some other attribute that is correlated with green buildings. In case of the latter, it is essential to explore this confounding attribute in order to provide the right recommendation to the developer.

Let's explore some variables to see if they have a relationship with the green ratings

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

greenbuildingdata <- read.csv(file = 'greenbuildings.csv', sep=",")



ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=age, fill=as.factor(green_rating))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.7) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Green rating"))+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "limegreen")) + 
  labs(title = "Green rating by age")

ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=as.factor(class_a), fill=as.factor(green_rating))) +
  geom_bar() +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Green rating")) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "limegreen")) + xlab("class_a") +
  labs(caption = "(0 and 1 correspond to No and Yes respectively)", title ="Green rating by class a")

ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=leasing_rate, fill=as.factor(green_rating))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.7) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Green rating"))+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "limegreen"))+ 
  labs(title = "Green rating by leasing rate")

ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=cluster_rent, fill=as.factor(green_rating))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.7) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Green rating"))+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "green"))+ 
  labs(title = "Green rating by cluster rent")

ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=size, fill=as.factor(green_rating))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.7) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Green rating"))+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey", "limegreen"))+ 
  labs(title = "Green rating by size")
```

As we explored the many other variables in addition to the above graphs, the variable *age* i.e. the age of the building in years and the variable *class_a* i.e. the indicator of highest quality properties caught our attention. We could clearly see some patterns. The green buildings are mostly young and proportion of green buildings is higher among the class a buildings. 

Going back to our original question of the confounding variable, is it possible that the higher median rent of the green buildings was being driven by their age (*well this would be great for the developer since she is building a new property*)? Or is it possible that the green buildings in our data set came out to be desirable because many belonged to the class_a category? Let's find out. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=as.factor(class_a), y=Rent, fill="lightblue")) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightblue")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + xlab("Class_a") +
  labs(caption = "(0 and 1 correspond to No and Yes respectively)")+ ylab("Rent ($ per sq ft per year)")+ 
  labs(title = "Rent vs Class a")

ggplot(greenbuildingdata, aes(x=age, y=Rent,color="blue")) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("lightblue")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ ylab("Rent ($ per sq ft per year)")+ 
  labs(title = "Rent vs Age")

```

As seen from above, age and rent does not appear to have a correlation. The class_a indicator, however, seems to be influencing the rent. We can see that the median rent is higher for buildings which are qualified as class a. 

Now, let's look at the median rent values for green buildings split by whether they belong to the class a category of buildings or not.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

df <- greenbuildingdata %>% 
  group_by(class_a,green_rating) %>% 
  summarise(Rent = median(Rent))
ggplot(df, aes(x=as.factor(green_rating), y=Rent,fill=as.factor(class_a))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Rent, digits=2)), vjust=1.6,position = position_dodge(0.9), color="white", size=3.5) + xlab("Green rating") +
  labs(caption = "(0 and 1 correspond to No and Yes respectively)", title = "Rent vs Green rating and Class a") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Class a"))+ ylab("Rent ($ per sq ft per year)")


```

The median rent value for green buildings when they belong to the class a category is 28.44 but only 25.55 when they don't. Additionally, if the developer ends up investing in green building that doesn't belong to the class a category, the economic benefits are tend to be lower as compared to a class_a, non-green building. 

Now, given that the excel guru's insight is based on the premise that the green building will generate more revenue as compared to a non-green building, we can clearly see from above that might not be the case truly. The class a indicator seems to be playing a big role here. 

So, our recommendation to the developer would be to invest in a green building if it is also a class a building. 

Let's also look at the occupancy rates for these buildings:

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

df <- greenbuildingdata %>% 
  group_by(class_a,green_rating) %>% 
  summarise(Occupancy = median(leasing_rate))
ggplot(df, aes(x=as.factor(green_rating), y=Occupancy,fill=as.factor(class_a))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Occupancy, digits=2)), vjust=1.6,position = position_dodge(0.9), color="white", size=3.5)+ xlab("Green rating") +
  labs(caption = "(0 and 1 correspond to No and Yes respectively)", title="Occupancy rate vs Green rating and Class a") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Class a")) + ylab("Occupancy rate")

```


**Summarizing:**

* We first discovered that most green buildings are young and a higher proportion of green buildings belong to the class a category

* We then looked at the association of age and class a category with rent. Although, there was not a high correlation between age and rent, we could clearly see that the median rent value of class a buildings is higher as compared to those that aren't class a

* The above suggests a possibility that higher rent value of the green buildings as concluded by the Excel guru might not be because of their green certification, but rather because of their class a qualification

* As we deep-dived to check the median rent values for buildings split by both their green certification and class a qualification, we discovered that median rent value of a non-class a, green building is lower than that of a class a, non-green building. Hence, it wouldn't be wise for the real estate developer to invest into a green building without exploring the class status of the building 

* We also checked the occupancy rate of the buildings for this split, which is also higher for class a buildings

* Considering the above points - we recommend the real estate developer invest in a green building only if it is also a class a building

# Association Rule Mining

The data contains a list of grocery purchases with each row representing one shopping basket containing one or more grocery items. Our analysis aims at finding interesting association rules between these items. This is followed by a few recommendations that the grocery stores can consider in order to leverage these discoveries and enhance the customer experience / sales.

Let's run the Apriori algorithm.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(arules)  
library(arulesViz)
library(splitstackshape)

groceries <- read.table("groceries.txt",sep="\t",fill=TRUE)
groceries$basketid <- rownames(groceries) 
groceries.map <- cSplit(groceries, "V1", ",", direction = "long")
groceries <- split(groceries.map$V1, f = groceries.map$basketid)
groceries <- lapply(groceries, unique)

grocerytrans = as(groceries, "transactions")

rules = apriori(grocerytrans, 
                     parameter=list(support=.005, confidence=.1, maxlen=6))
plot(rules)
```

In the chart above, we can see just a few data points that fall beyond 0.05 value of support. Let’s look at these comparatively high support associations.

**Subset of rules when support > 0.05**
```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

inspect(subset(rules, subset = support > 0.05))
plot(subset(rules, subset = support > 0.05), method="graph")
```

As expected, high support grocery item sets are also the popular ones. We can see a lot of rows with empty left-hand side. Their right-hand side contain the super popular items that are meeting our minimum support threshold. Their confidence, however, is low as compared to the rest of the associations because they condition on nothing but the entire data set. Further, in the below chart (where red to green represent low to high betweenness centrality), whole milk and vegetables appear to have very high betweenness centrality.

Nevertheless, aren’t milk and vegetables some things that we have in our own baskets on most of our grocery shopping trips? So let’s explore further to see if we can find some more interesting associations. 

Again, if we look at the very first graph, there are only a few data point whose confidence is above 0.6. Let’s check them out.

**Subset of rules when confidence > 0.6**
```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
inspect(subset(rules, subset=confidence > 0.6))

plot(subset(rules, subset = confidence > 0.6), method="graph")
```


Here are some of the associations. Other vegetables appear quite often in grocery baskets that contain root vegetables, fruits, milk etc. Similarly, whole milk seems to be frequently present in grocery baskets that contain vegetables, fruits, butter, cream or yogurt. 

Grocery stores may consider having the dairy and vegetable sections adjacent to each other for the ease of navigation may enhance the customer experience. The below chart is also helpful to visualize different clusters of our items - we can see dairy and vegetables go together.

![](Pictures_AssociationRules/screenshot_041007.png)

Confidence, however, is not enough to evaluate the strength of the associations. It is also worthwhile to consider how this confidence relates to the expected confidence (i.e. baseline occurrence) of the rhs item, essentially the lift.

![](Pictures_AssociationRules/Captureformulalift.png)

A lift of 1 would mean that the lhs and rhs item sets are independent, essentially no association. So, we want to look at some high lift associations. Below is again the very first graph, but with lift on the y-axis. Only a few data points fall above 3.5 value of lift. Let's take a loot at these.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
plot(rules, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#inspect(subset(rules, lift > 3.5))
```

![](Pictures_AssociationRules/Picture1.png)

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
plot(subset(rules, subset = lift > 3.5), method="graph")
```

All of the above item sets appear quite infrequently in our data set. The lift, however, is high and suggests that grocery stores maybe able to increase the sales of these items by leveraging these association rules. 

We had earlier suggested that grocery stores may consider having the dairy and vegetable sections alongside each other for the convenience of the customers. Here are some more recommendations based on the high lift associations we just saw:

* Berries can be put alongside whipped/sour cream in the stores as their likelihood to be purchased with whipped/sour cream is about 3.8 times higher as compared to their baseline likelihood of being bought. Strawberries with whipped cream - people surely have a good taste!

* Ham is more likely to be purchased along with the white bread. Grocery stores can have them on display together along with advertisement posters of a recipe that include them. It is also interesting that root vegetables are more likely to be purchased with beef. Something similar could be done with these as well

* Napkins and hygiene products can be made available for some combo discounts
